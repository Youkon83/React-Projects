# Better Pizza Co.

Used React router, redux, thunks, geolocation, and tailwind CSS to create a professional looking web application for a mock pizza company.
Has an interactive menu where you can add or delete from your cart, adjust quantites. You can open your cart, and place your order, or clear it. After placing order you are taken to a page to input your name, phone number, and your address- you can also click a button to have geolocation autofill your address. After sumbission you are taken to an order summary page with an order ID# items ordered, total price, time left for delivery.
