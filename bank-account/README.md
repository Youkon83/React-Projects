# Bank Account

A small mock bank account app using useReducer

All buttons are are pretty much self explanitory. Open account opens your account with a balance of 500, and enables all other buttons. Only 1 loan can be requested at a time, if balance is 0 another can be requested. In order to close account both the loan, and account balance must be 0.
There is obviously a lot of room to expand upon in this app, but leaving it as is since it was mostly for practicing the useReducer hook.
